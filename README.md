### Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

#### About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

#### Learning outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.

#### *Personal Notes:
Enjoyed working on this program. It was rather tricky though I must admit. Drove home the importance of breaking down complex logic into blocks/chunks and using functions to address those blocks of logic, and to tie them all together into a functioning script.
<br><br>
Currently on Version _v00 which addressed the unit tests to allow the script to pass the unit tests on JetBrains Academy.
<br><br>
Intent to work on a _v01 that will have a better user experience. Would rather use the numeric keypad to input the grid coordinates, meaning people playing the game do not need to concern themselves with obscure coordinate input such as 1,1 or 3, 2.
